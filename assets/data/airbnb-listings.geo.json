If you're wanting to visit New York and feel like a local rather than a tourist, this is THE place to stay.  You won't see a lot of tourists, but you'll see the locals--out walking their dogs, going to get their groceries at Zabar's, visiting the restaurants, bars, etc. There are all kinds of beautiful old buildings, restaurants and diners, and Central Park is within walking distance. So, if you want to get a local feel for the city, this is the place to stay! Easy access to public transportation.

I've lived in the West Village, East Village, Union Square, Tribeca, and now The Lower East Side.  One of the last neighborhoods in New York City to go through gentrification, I still feel as though it is a beautiful melting pot of art, culture and culinary magic.  It truly a \"neighborhood\".  I hope if you stay in the LES, I hope you explore and come to feel the same way.\r\n\r\nI work quite a lot and have to travel quite a bit but I do love it.  My favorite places to be are the highlands of Scotland, Costa Rica, and pretty much haven't seen a beach I didnt like:)  \r\n\r\nLife motto: \"Smooth seas don't make skillful sailor\"",

I have also lived in Paris, London, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC.\r\n\r\nI love to explore, laugh, live and learn- and I am thankful that my job allows me to do so. I am a journalist, writer, and creative consultant. I was also a model for the first 5 years of my adult years, which allowed me to meet some of the most amazing people in the world. I am a huge environmental advocate, and I am very much into a clean and green way of life. :-)\r\n\r\nLastly, I love vintage clothes, Thai food, chicken&waffles and music from the 80's and 90s.",

You can always hear me talking to my friends raving about travel opportunities and places. \r\n\r\nCan't live without: Travel, Family, Simple life, fun experiences \r\n\r\nTravel!!: I am working on traveling everywhere, but right now my fav destinations would be Thailand for it's unique cultural experiences, tasty cuisine, and interesting outdoor activities to take part in! Bali is also a close second with its chill atmosphere and great places to meditate, do yoga, surf, and just hang out with friendly locals! \r\n\r\nBooks: I love those books that are unconventional. I love to listen to other people's opinions and formulate my own on all kinds of topics, particularly living styles. Think and Grow Rich is on my kindle right now. \r\n\r\nShows: Anthony Bordain! ( get to see all the cool foods around the world I can eat), House Hunters International (get to see all the cool places around the world I can live in), Bizarre foods with Andrew Zimmerman ( get to experience unique food eating without having to eat them myself!), Friends (just because it's a classic), Modern Family (bc it's a modern take on comedy like Friends) anything cool \r\n\r\nMusic: Anything that sounds cool to me, could be mainstream, could be indie, could be \"hipster\" \r\n\r\nFood: All kinds! But particularly on the healthier side of things, less red meat, more vegetation! \r\n\r\nI love to go to hostels and meet new people traveling like myself, share our experiences, and learn a thing or two. \r\n\r\nIf I hosted, I would be so enthusiastic about showing guests around town and making them feel more like a friend than anything else. \r\n\r\nLife Motto: Being Unrealistic IS realistic.",
