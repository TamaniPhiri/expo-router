If you're wanting to visit New York and feel like a local rather than a tourist, this is THE place to stay.  You won't see a lot of tourists, but you'll see the locals--out walking their dogs, going to get their groceries at Zabar's, visiting the restaurants, bars, etc. There are all kinds of beautiful old buildings, restaurants and diners, and Central Park is within walking distance. So, if you want to get a local feel for the city, this is the place to stay! Easy access to public transportation.

I've lived in the West Village, East Village, Union Square, Tribeca, and now The Lower East Side.  One of the last neighborhoods in New York City to go through gentrification, I still feel as though it is a beautiful melting pot of art, culture and culinary magic.  It truly a \"neighborhood\".  I hope if you stay in the LES, I hope you explore and come to feel the same way.\r\n\r\nI work quite a lot and have to travel quite a bit but I do love it.  My favorite places to be are the highlands of Scotland, Costa Rica, and pretty much haven't seen a beach I didnt like:)  \r\n\r\nLife motto: \"Smooth seas don't make skillful sailor\"",

I am a huge environmental advocate, and I am very much into a clean and green way of life. :-)\r\n\r\nLastly, I love vintage clothes, Thai food, chicken&waffles and music from the 80's and 90s.",

You can always hear me talking to my friends raving about travel opportunities and places. \r\n\r\nCan't live without: Travel, Family, Simple life, fun experiences \r\n\r\nTravel!!: I am working on traveling everywhere, but right now my fav destinations would be Thailand for it's unique cultural experiences, tasty cuisine, and interesting outdoor activities to take part in! Bali is also a close second with its chill atmosphere and great places to meditate, do yoga, surf, and just hang out with friendly locals! \r\n\r\nBooks: I love those books that are unconventional. I love to listen to other people's opinions and formulate my own on all kinds of topics, particularly living styles. Think and Grow Rich is on my kindle right now. \r\n\r\nShows: Anthony Bordain! ( get to see all the cool foods around the world I can eat), House Hunters International (get to see all the cool places around the world I can live in), Bizarre foods with Andrew Zimmerman ( get to experience unique food eating without having to eat them myself!), Friends (just because it's a classic), Modern Family (bc it's a modern take on comedy like Friends) anything cool \r\n\r\nMusic: Anything that sounds cool to me, could be mainstream, could be indie, could be \"hipster\" \r\n\r\nFood: All kinds! But particularly on the healthier side of things, less red meat, more vegetation! \r\n\r\nI love to go to hostels and meet new people traveling like myself, share our experiences, and learn a thing or two. \r\n\r\nIf I hosted, I would be so enthusiastic about showing guests around town and making them feel more like a friend than anything else. \r\n\r\nLife Motto: Being Unrealistic IS realistic.",

The village has amazing charm, with coffee shops and quaint streets around every corner. Some of the best shopping and restaurants can be found in SOHO, a few blocks away. Washington Square Park & NYU are a short 2 block walk, and it's a 5 minute stroll to the Hudson River and West Village.  This apartment is truly in the dead center of Greenwich Village as opposed to some other listings which, although they claimto be in the village, are actually further out and in a completely different neighborhood.",

My roommate Shea is a choreographer, and has a little friendly dog named Peanut.  When our whole apartment is rented, we take the dog with us; if you're just renting one of the rooms- Peanut will likely be here, so I hope you like a friendly dog:)  I love my neighborhood and have lived here for 6 years, and love showing people around... I've even created an \"empanada tour\", as there are many places in my hood that are REALLY GOOD at empanadas.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the 2 rooms & Bath, we have a full kitchen, living room, and what we call \"the dance room\"... which is equipped with a wall of mirrors, 1 of 2 massage chairs, a desk, and 2 pianos.  You are more than welcome to play the pianos and dance all you want, but ask you stop making a lot of noise after 10pm on weekdays and midnight on weekends:)  \nIF you want to add someone to stay on an air mattress in the dance room, just note the additional charge and let me know---and I'll make up the bed!",

I do use the place when it's not rented out and I like to come home to these things. I love this place, so just take care of it, but by all means make yourself at home!",

The apartment is just steps away from incredible bars, restaurants and shops. Hop across the street in the warmer months to browse the famed Hester Street Fair. Some neighborhood staples include Doughnut Plant, Kossar's Bialy and The Pickle Guys. North Dumpling is delicious and perfect for those traveling on a budget. These are ALL within 2 blocks of the apartment.  Across the street is a track with tennis, racquet and basketball courts. Each is available at a first come first serve basis, which is very rare and wonderful for NYC (most others require permits)! I have 2 tennis racquets and a basketball for your use, and you can purchase tennis balls at the bodega half a block down Essex on the corner of Hester street.",

I'm a graduate student in Columbia's MFA Film Program in Creative Producing. I am currently finishing up my degree, producing independent films, writing, working a coffee shop gig, doing lots of yoga, and loving my life!\r\n\r\nI have a love affair with New York City and like to share that passion with my guests - tips, the \"best of\" advice, etc. Some of my other life pleasures are good coffee, sarcasm and dark humor, cooking, whiskey, the ocean/beach, late night city-walks with my dog, meditation and yoga, traveling, and staring at the moon.\r\n\r\nSome favorites: Paris and the south of France, the films \"Taxi Driver\" and Baz Luhrman's \"Romeo + Juliet,\" VEGGIES and good seafood, on the cuisine front, and MY DOG!!\r\n\r\nAround the apartment, I'm a pretty private, introspective and quiet person. I generally like to keep to myself and value the space as my place where I can be alone and away from having to interact with the world. Outside, in the \"world,\" I'm a mixed bag - a surefire extrovert, with introvert tendencies from time to time.\r\n\r\nMy life motto, if you will...the thought I try to keep in mind to keep me centered: the past is done, the future does not exist, the only thing that is REAL, is now.",

Wall St, the charging bull, battery park, the Statue of Liberty, 911 Memorial and the reflection pond, and Brooklyn Bridge are all within walkable distance. A little bit further more of walking, you will find yourself in Chinatown already. This neighborhood is relatively like concrete jungle compared to the other parts of Manhattan but it has its own beauty. You'll know what I'm talking about when you find yourself at the observatory at One World Center.",

Openfolio brings the power of networks \u2013 openness, connectivity, collective intelligence \u2013 to the world of personal investing. It's pretty cool and I'm really proud of what we've built.

Madison square park a few blocks away, the Hudson River just a few minutes walk west, the High Line in Meatpacking/Chelsea is about 20 minutes away. Except for LES and everything uptown, you're close to everything. But if you want to get to Central Park you can walk to the train and it will take you 10 minutes on the train, and Harlem just 20-25. Brooklyn is 10-15 minutes on the train, depending on where you're going (Williamsburg and Greenpoint are closest).

The neighborhood is charming and quiet yet filled with tons of the best restaurants, bagel stores, cafes and bars (I will leave you a list of everything you need to know and where to go). Tribeca is also steps away from some of the best Manhattan neighborhoods. Including SOHO, which has the most amazing shopping and the west village which has great night life, as well as Chinatown and Nolita. The apartment is also blocks away from the Hudson River park where you can lay out, bike ride, play mini golf, take a boat road or just enjoy the beautiful views and grounds of the park.",

Ha ha (I'm only half kidding).\r\nI'm very sensitive with my space, so I'm looking for artist, students of life, centered good-vibe folks who are coming to the city to explore their inner creativity. We have a kitchen, washer and dryer in the basement and we are in the upper most part of Manhattan. So you can enjoy the city, but still escape to a little nook that is walking distance from Inwood Hill Park and the Hudson River.",

I love traveling, trying new foods, Game of Thrones, sports and hanging out with friends. \r\n\r\nI live with two roommates in a beautiful 3BD apartment in the East Village. We are all laid back, 22-23 year old guys that love to have a good time. While we all like to go out and explore the city, we are very clean and respectful of each other's spaces. Due to our demanding professional careers, you can expect to have the whole house to yourself during your stay. However when we are home, we love to relax, watch TV and have a beer!",

Ha ha (I'm only half kidding).\r\nI'm very sensitive with my space, so I'm looking for artist, students of life, centered good-vibe folks who are coming to the city to explore their inner creativity. We have a kitchen, washer and dryer in the basement and we are in the upper most part of Manhattan. So you can enjoy the city, but still escape to a little nook that is walking distance from Inwood Hill Park and the Hudson River.",

I'm a graduate student in Columbia's MFA Film Program in Creative Producing. I am currently finishing up my degree, producing independent films, writing, working a coffee shop gig, doing lots of yoga, and loving my life!\r\n\r\nI have a love affair with New York City and like to share that passion with my guests - tips, the \"best of\" advice, etc. Some of my other life pleasures are good coffee, sarcasm and dark humor, cooking, whiskey, the ocean/beach, late night city-walks with my dog, meditation and yoga, traveling, and staring at the moon.\r\n\r\nSome favorites: Paris and the south of France, the films \"Taxi Driver\" and Baz Luhrman's \"Romeo + Juliet,\" VEGGIES and good seafood, on the cuisine front, and MY DOG!!\r\n\r\nAround the apartment, I'm a pretty private, introspective and quiet person. I generally like to keep to myself and value the space as my place where I can be alone and away from having to interact with the world. Outside, in the \"world,\" I'm a mixed bag - a surefire extrovert, with introvert tendencies from time to time.\r\n\r\nMy life motto, if you will...the thought I try to keep in mind to keep me centered: the past is done, the future does not exist, the only thing that is REAL, is now.",

My favorite travel destinations include Paris, Rome, Galapagos Islands, The Grand Canyon,  and Accra Ghana.  As a traveler, I appreciate clean accomodations that are warm and tasteful, with friendly/helpful people, and easy access to the things I like most.  \r\n     I believe this apartment reflects my interests and values and anyone would feel immediately comfortable and content gaining respite here in the great city of New York.",

She's always on hand if you ask for her help and a very flexible travel companion. When I asked her to go backpacking with me, she was totally up for it, even when she had never tried it before. And she more than pulls her weight. Her apartment in New York is in a great location - great restaurants and nightlife nearby - and is very clean with new-looking everything.\" - Jen\r\n\r\n\"Esther is a fantastic person and roommate, which is how we initially met. We've been friends ever since. She's honest, kind, intelligent, well-traveled, fair and fun, and a great person with whom to share space. She has my highest endorsement.\" - Carolyn",
