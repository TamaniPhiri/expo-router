Most of the bargain-clothing stores and pickle vendors have given way to indie boutiques and scenery eateries, though there are a few cherished survivors of the former Jewish stronghold, including venerable smoked-fish purveyors Russ & Daughters and pastrami legend Katz\u2019s Delicatessen. The Tenement Museum keeps the neighborhood\u2019s history alive in a series of restored apartments visited via themed guided tours, but most of the area\u2019s cultural draws are contemporary: The arrival of the New Museum on the Bowery several years ago drew numerous art galleries to the LES (TIME OUT Magazine).",

One of the last neighborhoods in New York City to go through gentrification, I still feel as though it is a beautiful melting pot of art, culture and culinary magic.  It truly a \"neighborhood\".  I hope if you stay in the LES, I hope you explore and come to feel the same way.\r\n\r\nI work quite a lot and have to travel quite a bit but I do love it.  My favorite places to be are the highlands of Scotland, Costa Rica, and pretty much haven't seen a beach I didnt like:)  \r\n\r\nLife motto: \"Smooth seas don't make skillful sailor\"",

You can always hear me talking to my friends raving about travel opportunities and places. \r\n\r\nCan't live without: Travel, Family, Simple life, fun experiences \r\n\r\nTravel!!: I am working on traveling everywhere, but right now my fav destinations would be Thailand for it's unique cultural experiences, tasty cuisine, and interesting outdoor activities to take part in! Bali is also a close second with its chill atmosphere and great places to meditate, do yoga, surf, and just hang out with friendly locals! \r\n\r\nBooks: I love those books that are unconventional. I love to listen to other people's opinions and formulate my own on all kinds of topics, particularly living styles. Think and Grow Rich is on my kindle right now. \r\n\r\nShows: Anthony Bordain! ( get to see all the cool foods around the world I can eat), House Hunters International (get to see all the cool places around the world I can live in), Bizarre foods with Andrew Zimmerman ( get to experience unique food eating without having to eat them myself!), Friends (just because it's a classic), Modern Family (bc it's a modern take on comedy like Friends) anything cool \r\n\r\nMusic: Anything that sounds cool to me, could be mainstream, could be indie, could be \"hipster\" \r\n\r\nFood: All kinds! But particularly on the healthier side of things, less red meat, more vegetation! \r\n\r\nI love to go to hostels and meet new people traveling like myself, share our experiences, and learn a thing or two. \r\n\r\nIf I hosted, I would be so enthusiastic about showing guests around town and making them feel more like a friend than anything else. \r\n\r\nLife Motto: Being Unrealistic IS realistic.",

The TKTS Discount Booth (where theater tickets are sold at up to 50% off face value) is topped with a giant red staircase, open to visitors daily until 1am. Elsewhere in Times Square, the City has created several new pedestrian-only zones furnished with tables and chairs, perfect for people-watching. The neighborhood is central to Midtown West, located near the Theatre District and Broadway shows.",

The village has amazing charm, with coffee shops and quaint streets around every corner. Some of the best shopping and restaurants can be found in SOHO, a few blocks away. Washington Square Park & NYU are a short 2 block walk, and it's a 5 minute stroll to the Hudson River and West Village.  This apartment is truly in the dead center of Greenwich Village as opposed to some other listings which, although they claimto be in the village, are actually further out and in a completely different neighborhood.",

I recently started a new business with my partner and I will be transitioning to Miami this winter.\r\nIn the meantime, I'm just want to finish out some business here in the city and will be going back and forth. \r\nMy roommate is Simba, a short hair domestic kitty...actually, he owns the place, I just live here. Ha ha (I'm only half kidding).\r\nI'm very sensitive with my space, so I'm looking for artist, students of life, centered good-vibe folks who are coming to the city to explore their inner creativity. We have a kitchen, washer and dryer in the basement and we are in the upper most part of Manhattan. So you can enjoy the city, but still escape to a little nook that is walking distance from Inwood Hill Park and the Hudson River.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Conveniently located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan this apt is nestled quietly between York & East End. Due to its location, it is inherently quieter and receives far less traffic than the main thoroughfares. Walking two blocks west will take you to second ave which is where things begin to get fancy. Walking south will first take you into midtown which includes Korea Town, the Empire State Building, NY Lib, Grand Central. Broadway is slightly further west.",
    "notes": "I can provide you with details regarding NYC if this is your first visit. Useful information such as subway locations, useful apps, entertainment and more. Please note the apartment is on the 5th floor of a walk-up (no elevator access)",
    "transit": "Subways lines are located 5 blocks west and 2 blocks south of the apt. It is a brisk walk. Bus lines run on York which is the street directly to the left of the apt when exiting. Ubers, Lyfts and Taxis are plentiful.",
    "access": "The entire space! However, it's merely a shoebox. But it will be YOUR shoebox. How cozy.",
    "interaction": "I will be available to assist you via phone and email most times of the day. Response time on average is 1-2 hours. Neither me nor Bento my little shih-tzu will be on the premises. He is hypo-allergenic and the apartment is completely sanitary so for those with dog allergies: fear not!",
    "house_rules": "Please treat the space with respect for those around you. The building is quiet so partying should probably be done at the bar/club. (There really isn't even enough room for the half-pipe anyway).",
