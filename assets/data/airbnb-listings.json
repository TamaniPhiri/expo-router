Most of the bargain-clothing stores and pickle vendors have given way to indie boutiques and scenery eateries, though there are a few cherished survivors of the former Jewish stronghold, including venerable smoked-fish purveyors Russ & Daughters and pastrami legend Katz\u2019s Delicatessen. The Tenement Museum keeps the neighborhood\u2019s history alive in a series of restored apartments visited via themed guided tours, but most of the area\u2019s cultural draws are contemporary: The arrival of the New Museum on the Bowery several years ago drew numerous art galleries to the LES (TIME OUT Magazine).",

One of the last neighborhoods in New York City to go through gentrification, I still feel as though it is a beautiful melting pot of art, culture and culinary magic.  It truly a \"neighborhood\".  I hope if you stay in the LES, I hope you explore and come to feel the same way.\r\n\r\nI work quite a lot and have to travel quite a bit but I do love it.  My favorite places to be are the highlands of Scotland, Costa Rica, and pretty much haven't seen a beach I didnt like:)  \r\n\r\nLife motto: \"Smooth seas don't make skillful sailor\"",

You can always hear me talking to my friends raving about travel opportunities and places. \r\n\r\nCan't live without: Travel, Family, Simple life, fun experiences \r\n\r\nTravel!!: I am working on traveling everywhere, but right now my fav destinations would be Thailand for it's unique cultural experiences, tasty cuisine, and interesting outdoor activities to take part in! Bali is also a close second with its chill atmosphere and great places to meditate, do yoga, surf, and just hang out with friendly locals! \r\n\r\nBooks: I love those books that are unconventional. I love to listen to other people's opinions and formulate my own on all kinds of topics, particularly living styles. Think and Grow Rich is on my kindle right now. \r\n\r\nShows: Anthony Bordain! ( get to see all the cool foods around the world I can eat), House Hunters International (get to see all the cool places around the world I can live in), Bizarre foods with Andrew Zimmerman ( get to experience unique food eating without having to eat them myself!), Friends (just because it's a classic), Modern Family (bc it's a modern take on comedy like Friends) anything cool \r\n\r\nMusic: Anything that sounds cool to me, could be mainstream, could be indie, could be \"hipster\" \r\n\r\nFood: All kinds! But particularly on the healthier side of things, less red meat, more vegetation! \r\n\r\nI love to go to hostels and meet new people traveling like myself, share our experiences, and learn a thing or two. \r\n\r\nIf I hosted, I would be so enthusiastic about showing guests around town and making them feel more like a friend than anything else. \r\n\r\nLife Motto: Being Unrealistic IS realistic.",

The TKTS Discount Booth (where theater tickets are sold at up to 50% off face value) is topped with a giant red staircase, open to visitors daily until 1am. Elsewhere in Times Square, the City has created several new pedestrian-only zones furnished with tables and chairs, perfect for people-watching. The neighborhood is central to Midtown West, located near the Theatre District and Broadway shows.",

The village has amazing charm, with coffee shops and quaint streets around every corner. Some of the best shopping and restaurants can be found in SOHO, a few blocks away. Washington Square Park & NYU are a short 2 block walk, and it's a 5 minute stroll to the Hudson River and West Village.  This apartment is truly in the dead center of Greenwich Village as opposed to some other listings which, although they claimto be in the village, are actually further out and in a completely different neighborhood.",
